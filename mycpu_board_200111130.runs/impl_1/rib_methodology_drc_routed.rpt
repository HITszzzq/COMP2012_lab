2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_mycpu/u_controler/alu_opcode_o_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_mycpu/u_controler/imm_sel_o_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_mycpu/u_controler/imm_sel_o_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_mycpu/u_controler/imm_sel_o_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_mycpu/u_controler/imm_sel_o_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch
